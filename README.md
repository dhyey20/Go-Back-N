# Go-Back-N
Implementation of the Go Back N protocol

##Objectives
In this project, you will implement the Go-back-N automatic repeat request (ARQ) scheme and carry out a number
of experiments to evaluate its performance. In the process I expect that you will develop a good understanding of
ARQ schemes and reliable data transfer protocols and build a number of fundamental skills related to writing
transport layer services, including:
• encapsulating application data into transport layer segments by including transport headers,
• buffering and managing data received from, or to be delivered to, the application,
• managing the window size at the sender,
• computing checksums, and
• using the UDP socket interface.
